Hey there 👋

I’m a Full-Stack Developer with a passion for turning ideas into powerful, production-ready applications.  
Using the MERN stack as my toolkit, I’ve built everything from **multi-tenant SaaS platforms** to **real-time chat systems** to **secure e-commerce backends**.

Right now, I’m crafting scalable systems at MNB Soft Solution Pvt. Ltd., where my day can go from architecting database structures to perfecting a drag-and-drop Kanban board… and sometimes debugging things that “shouldn’t” break.

I thrive on projects where performance, user experience, and clean architecture all meet.  
In my past work, I’ve tackled complex role-based permissions, real-time notifications, and multi-industry dashboards that adapt dynamically to client needs.

When I’m not coding, I’m either exploring the latest in web tech, planning my next trek, or enjoying music (ideally *not* while fixing production issues at 2 AM).
